What is Relational Database?
It means the data is stored as well as retrieved in the form of relations(tables).
Eg:-
ROLL_NO	NAME	ADDRESS	PHONE	AGE
1	RAM	DELHI	9455123451	18
2	RAMESH	GURGAON	9652431543	18
3	SUJIT	ROHTAK	9156253131	20
4	SURESH	DELHI	9156768971	18

Attributes:- These are the properties which defines relations. Eg:- Name, Address etc.
Tuple:- Each row in the relations is known as tuple. Above contains 4.
 The above contains 4. The one of which
1	RAM	DELHI	9455123451	18

Degree:- The no. of attributes in the relations is known as Degree of the realtion. The above contains 5
Cardinality :- The number of tuples in a relation is known as cardinality.
Column :-

		-----------------------------
The queries to deal with in relational database can be categorized as :-
Data Definition Language :- It is used to define the structure of the database. For eg:- CREATE TABLE, ADD COLUMN, DROP COLUMN etc.
Data Manipulation Language :- It is used to manipulate data in relations. eg:- INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE and so on.
Data Query Language :- It is used to extract data from relations. Eg :- 
CASE 1:-
SELECT ROLL_NO, NAME FROM STUDENT;
ROLL_NO	NAME
1	RAM
2	RAMESH
3	SUJIT
4	SURESH

CASE 2:-
SELECT ROLL_NO, NAME FROM STUDENT WHERE ROLL_NO>2;
ROLL_NO	NAME
3	SUJIT
4	SURESH

CASE 3:-
SELECT * FROM STUDENT WHERE ROLL_NO>2;
ROLL_NO	NAME	ADDRESS	PHONE	AGE
3	SUJIT	ROHTAK	9156253131	20
4	SURESH	DELHI	9156768971	18

CASE 4:-
SELECT * FROM STUDENT ORDER BY AGE; equivalents to ORDER BY AGE ASC.

ROLL_NO	NAME	ADDRESS	PHONE	AGE
1	RAM	DELHI	9455123451	18
2	RAMESH	GURGAON	9652431543	18
4	SURESH	DELHI	9156768971	18
3	SUJIT	ROHTAK	9156253131	20

For decending order :- SELECT * FROM STUDENT ORDER BY AGE DESC;

CASE 5:-
SELECT DISTINCT ADDRESS FROM STUDENT;
ADDRESS
DELHI
GURGAON
ROHTAK
		-----------------------------------

AGGREGATIONS FUNCTIONS-
They are used to perform mathematical operations on data values of relations. Some common aggregation functions are :-

COUNT:- This is used to count the number of rows in a realtion.
SELECT COUNT (PHONE) FROM STUDENT;
COUNT(PHONE)
4

SUM :- SELECT SUM(AGE) FROM STUDENT;
SUM(AGE)
74

IN THE SAME WAY MIN, MAX & AVG can be used. All aggregations functions returns only one row.

		-------------------------------

GROUP BY:- 	Group by is used to group the tuples of a relation based on attributes or group of attribute. It is always combined with aggregation function which is computed on group.
Eg:-
SELECT ADDRESS, SUM(AGE) FROM STUDENT GROUP BY (ADDRESS);
ADDRESS	SUM(AGE)
DELHI	36
GURGAON	18
ROHTAK	20

The above query will result in an error. So we use aggregation functions for ROLL_NO to sort this.

SELECT ROLL_NO, ADDRESS, SUM(AGE) FROM STUDENT GROUP BY (ADDRESS);

		SQL DATATYPES
		-------------
1. Binary Datatypes:-
	i)binary:- max. length of 8000 bytes(fixed length binary data)
	ii)varbinary:- max. length of 8000 bytes(variable length binary data)
	iii)varbinary(max):- of 231 bytes(variable length binary data)
	iv)image:- variable length binary data

2. Exact
There are nine subtypes.
	1. bigint
	2. int
	3. smallint
	4. tinyint
	5. bit
	6. decimal 
	7. numeric
	8. money
	9. smallmoney
